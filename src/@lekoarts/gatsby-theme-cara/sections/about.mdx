## About Me

> How I got into software development...

Originally interested in gaining technical skills to expand my research abilities in the field of International Relations, I discovered a genuine joy for software development. I love the gratification of building applications from the ground up. In 2022, I graduated from Flatiron School's full-stack software development bootcamp and I'm excited to finally start my career in tech!

> Programming languages I've used...

I have experience creating full-stack web applications in mostly React.js and Ruby on Rails. For a more complete list of my skills, feel free to take a look at my resume or visit my [Linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dijiang0/).
